# Welcome to the FieldTrip website

FieldTrip is the MATLAB software toolbox for MEG, EEG, iEEG and NIRS analysis. It offers preprocessing and advanced analysis methods, such as time-frequency analysis, source reconstruction using dipoles, distributed sources and beamformers and non-parametric statistical testing. It supports the [data formats](/faq/dataformat) of all major MEG systems and of the most popular EEG, iEEG and NIRS systems. New data formats can be [added easily](/faq/how_can_i_import_my_own_dataformat). FieldTrip contains high-level functions that you can use to construct your own analysis protocols as a MATLAB script.

The FieldTrip software is released free of charge as [open source software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) under the GNU [general public license](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html).
