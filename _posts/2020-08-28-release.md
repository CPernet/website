### 28 August, 2020

We have been working hard to improve support for the analysis of NIRS data. The new FieldTrip release [20200828](http://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/releases/tag/20200828) features several improvements to the reading of NIRS data for SNIRF, Homer and Artinis, NIRS data handling and plotting. Moreover, we have added added the option `cfg.newfigure` to all plotting functions to allow you to specify whether the plots should be made in a new figure (or not). See [GitHub](https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/compare/20200828...20200826) for the detailled list of updates.
