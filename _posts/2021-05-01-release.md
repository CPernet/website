### 01 May, 2021

FieldTrip version [20210501](http://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/releases/tag/20210501) has been released with support for handling of fMRI time series data! The idea is to convert a 4D fMRI representation into a source representation, and from there into a parcellated raw data representation from which it would be straight-forward to use the time-domain analysis methods :) In addition, we updated [ft_datatype_parcellation](https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/reference/ft_datatype_parcellation/) and [ft_datatype_segmentation](https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/reference/ft_datatype_segmentation/) and added suppport for [Polhemus](https://polhemus.com/motion-tracking/all-trackers/liberty) CSV files. See [GitHub](https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/compare/20210422...20210501) for the detailed list of updates.
