#### Commits

- [ea90086](http://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/commit/ea90086) FIX - removed "keyboard" from the test script, this caused it to never complete in time
- [7d3ba37](http://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip/commit/7d3ba37) ENH - updatewd test script, ft_channelrepair started to fail if there were no channels to repair. The data structure used in the test had all 275 channels. Now it removes two channels, and repairs them again.
